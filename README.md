In the exhilarating number guessing game between a computer and a person, players experience a dynamic blend of strategy and intuition. The game begins with the computer randomly selecting a number within a predefined range, say 1 to 100. The human player, armed with wit and numerical prowess, takes turns guessing the secret number while the computer adapts its responses with each attempt. As the player refines their guesses, the computer strategically adjusts its feedback, providing subtle hints like "too high" or "too low." The challenge lies in outsmarting the computer within a limited number of attempts. The competition builds as each guess brings the players closer to uncovering the elusive number. This interactive duel fosters an engaging and suspenseful experience, showcasing the synergy between human intuition and artificial intelligence in the realm of number guessing.
